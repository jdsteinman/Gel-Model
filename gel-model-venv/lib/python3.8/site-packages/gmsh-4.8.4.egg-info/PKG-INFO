Description: ====
        gmsh
        ====
        
        `Gmsh <https://gmsh.info>`_ is an automatic three-dimensional finite element
        mesh generator with built-in pre- and post-processing facilities.
        
        The aim of this package is to download and install the official Gmsh app and
        binary Software Development Kit (SDK) in a pythonic way, i.e. via the ``pip``
        command.
        
        Installation should work under Linux, Windows and macOS for both Python 2 and 3.
        
        Before installation make sure that possibly conflicting ``gmsh-dev``,
        ``gmsh-sdk`` or ``gmsh-sdk-git`` are uninstalled::
        
            $ pip uninstall gmsh-dev gmsh-sdk gmsh-sdk-git
        
        Then install (or upgrade) ``gmsh``::
        
            $ pip install --upgrade gmsh
        
        This can take a few seconds to a few minutes depending on your network
        connection, as the installer downloads the binary files for your architecture
        from https://gmsh.info.
        
        After installation you can either run the Gmsh app::
        
            $ gmsh
        
        or use the Gmsh Python API::
        
            $ python -c "import gmsh; gmsh.initialize(); gmsh.fltk.run(); gmsh.finalize()"
        
        (Note that the header files for using the C++ and C API are also installed, as
        is the Julia module.)
