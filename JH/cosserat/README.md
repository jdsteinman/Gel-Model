# Cosserat elasticity finite element solver

This repository contains a finite element solver for the planar Cosserat
elasticity problem using the DOLFIN finite element problem solving environment
from the [FEniCS Project](http://www.fenicsproject.org).

If you find this solver helpful for your research, we kindly ask that you

# Instructions

Clone this repository:

    git clone git@bitbucket.org:unilucompmech/cosserat.git

Install Docker (or FEniCS and gmsh) following the instructions at [docker.com](https://docker.com).       

Change directory into the folder containing the source:

    cd cosserat

Launch a Docker container:

    ./docker-run

Convert the gmsh geometry files to DOLFIN XML files:

    ./convert_meshes.py

Run an analysis, e.g.:

    python plate_with_inclusion.py
